## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a sophmore studying computer science at UTD. In my free time I love to workout, play video games, and watch anime (some of my favorites are Steins;Gate, FMAB, and Samurai Champloo). My interests within computer science lie in Cloud Services, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), AI, and full-stack development. I am skilled in C++, Java, Python, HTML/JS/CSS and have experience with React, Next, Express, and AWS.
